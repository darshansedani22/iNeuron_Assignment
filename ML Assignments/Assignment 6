1. In the sense of machine learning, what is a model? What is the best way to train a model?
Answer:
Model: A representation of patterns or relationships in data that captures underlying trends. It can make predictions or decisions.
Training: Process of using a dataset to teach a model to make accurate predictions. Involves adjusting model parameters using optimization algorithms.

2. In the sense of machine learning, explain the "No Free Lunch" theorem.
Answer:
States that there is no one universal algorithm or model that works best for all types of problems.
Emphasizes the importance of selecting the right algorithm based on the problem's characteristics.

3. Describe the K-fold cross-validation mechanism in detail.
Answer:
Technique to evaluate model performance by partitioning data into K subsets (folds).
In each iteration, one fold is used as a validation set, and the rest as training data. The process is repeated K times, and results are averaged.
Reduces the risk of overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of model performance.

4. Describe the bootstrap sampling method. What is the aim of it?
Answer:
Involves repeatedly resampling the original dataset with replacement to create multiple samples of the same size.
Aim: Approximating the sampling distribution of a statistic or estimator, which helps estimate the variability of the statistic.

5. What is the significance of calculating the Kappa value for a classification model? Demonstrate how to measure the Kappa value of a classification model using a sample collection of results.
Answer:
Kappa measures the agreement between observed and predicted classifications, considering chance agreement.
Accounts for the agreement that could happen by chance alone, providing a more accurate assessment of model performance.

6. Describe the model ensemble method. In machine learning, what part does it play?
Answer:
Ensemble method combines predictions from multiple models to improve overall performance and robustness.
Common techniques include bagging, boosting, and stacking.

7. What is a descriptive model's main purpose? Give examples of real-world problems that descriptive models were used to solve.
Answer:
Purpose: To understand and describe patterns and relationships in data.
Examples: Market segmentation, customer behavior analysis, disease outbreak analysis.

8. Describe how to evaluate a linear regression model.
Answer:
Common metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (Coefficient of Determination).

9. Distinguish :
1. Descriptive vs. predictive models
Answer:
Descriptive models explain data patterns, while predictive models make future predictions.

2. Underfitting vs. overfitting the model
Answer:
Underfitting is when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns. Overfitting is when a model is too complex and captures noise.

3. Bootstrapping vs. cross-validation
Answer:
Bootstrapping resamples data with replacement for estimating statistics. Cross-validation partitions data for model evaluation.

10. Make quick notes on:
1. LOOCV.
Answer:
K-fold CV where K equals the number of samples.

2. F-measurement
Answer:
Combines precision and recall to assess model performance.

3. The width of the silhouette
Answer:
Measures how close each data point in one cluster is to the points in the neighboring clusters.

4. Receiver operating characteristic curve
Answer:
Visualizes classification model's performance across different thresholds.
