1. What is the concept of supervised learning? What is the significance of the name?
Answer:
Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions. The name "supervised" refers to the presence of a supervisor or teacher who provides the algorithm with correct answers during training. The algorithm learns to map input data to the correct output based on these examples.

2. In the hospital sector, offer an example of supervised learning.
Answer:
Medical Diagnosis: Given historical patient data with labeled outcomes (e.g., disease or no disease), a supervised learning algorithm can be trained to predict whether a new patient has a particular medical condition based on their symptoms and test results.

3. Give three supervised learning examples.
Answer:
Email Spam Detection: Predict whether an email is spam or not based on its content and features.
Credit Scoring: Determine the creditworthiness of a loan applicant based on their financial history and other attributes.
Handwriting Recognition: Identify handwritten digits based on their pixel values in an image.

4. In supervised learning, what are classification and regression?
Answer:
Classification: Involves predicting a discrete class label for an input instance (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not spam).
Regression: Involves predicting a continuous numeric value as the output (e.g., predicting house prices based on features like area and location).

5. Give some popular classification algorithms as examples.
Answer:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
Naive Bayes

6. Briefly describe the SVM model.
Answer:
SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that aims to find a hyperplane that best separates different classes while maximizing the margin between them. It can handle linear and non-linear data by using kernel functions.

7. In SVM, what is the cost of misclassification?
Answer:
The cost of misclassification in SVM refers to the penalty assigned for incorrectly classifying data points. It allows adjusting the balance between avoiding false positives (misclassifying a positive as negative) and false negatives (misclassifying a negative as positive).

8. In the SVM model, define Support Vectors.
Answer:
Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane) between different classes. They play a crucial role in defining the position and orientation of the decision boundary.

9. In the SVM model, define the kernel.
Answer:
A kernel is a mathematical function used to transform the original feature space into a higher-dimensional space, making it possible to separate classes that are not linearly separable in the original space. Common kernel functions include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF).

10. What are the factors that influence SVM's effectiveness?
Answer:
Choice of kernel and its parameters
Selection of the regularization parameter (C)
Quality and quantity of training data
Handling of class imbalance
Preprocessing and feature engineering

11. What are the benefits of using the SVM model?
Answer:
Effective in high-dimensional spaces
Robust against overfitting (with proper tuning)
Can handle both linear and non-linear data
Works well for binary and multi-class classification
Effective with a small dataset

12.  What are the drawbacks of using the SVM model?
Answer:
Computationally expensive for large datasets
Requires proper selection of hyperparameters
Complex to interpret compared to simpler models
Can be sensitive to noisy data

13. Notes should be written on
1. The kNN algorithm has a validation flaw.
Answer:
The kNN algorithm may suffer from overfitting if k is too small.

2. In the kNN algorithm, the k value is chosen.
Answer:
The choice of k in the kNN algorithm affects the model's bias-variance trade-off.

3. A decision tree with inductive bias
Answer:
A decision tree uses an inductive bias to prefer simpler and more interpretable trees.

14. What are some of the benefits of the kNN algorithm?
Answer:
Simple to understand and implement
Works well with non-linear data
Can adapt to changes in data distribution

15. What are some of the kNN algorithm's drawbacks?
Answer:
Computationally expensive for large datasets
Sensitive to irrelevant features and noisy data
Choosing an optimal k value can be challenging

16. Explain the decision tree algorithm in a few words.
Answer:
A decision tree is a hierarchical structure that represents a series of decisions and their consequences. It recursively splits the data into subsets based on the most significant attributes.

17. What is the difference between a node and a leaf in a decision tree?
Answer:
Node: Represents a decision point where data is split based on a feature.
Leaf: Represents a terminal point where the final prediction or decision is made.

18. What is a decision tree's entropy?
Answer:
Entropy is a measure of impurity in a node. It quantifies the disorder or randomness in the distribution of classes within the node.

19. In a decision tree, define knowledge gain.
Answer:
Knowledge gain is the reduction in entropy or increase in purity achieved by splitting a node using a particular attribute.

20. Choose three advantages of the decision tree approach and write them down.
Answer:
Easy to understand and interpret
Handles both categorical and numerical data
Can capture non-linear relationships
Requires minimal data preprocessing

21. Make a list of three flaws in the decision tree process.
Answer:
Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees
Sensitive to small changes in data
Can create biased trees if one class dominates

22. Briefly describe the random forest model.
Answer:
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It works well with classification and regression tasks and handles noisy data effectively.
