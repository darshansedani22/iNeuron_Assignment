1. What is the underlying concept of Support Vector Machines?
Answer:
Support Vector Machines are supervised machine learning models used for classification and regression tasks. The concept is to find a hyperplane that best separates classes in a high-dimensional space. SVMs aim to maximize the margin (distance) between classes, while also allowing for some margin violations (soft margin) to handle overlapping data points.

2. What is the concept of a support vector?
Answer:
Support vectors are data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane) and have a role in determining the position and orientation of the hyperplane. They are the critical points that influence the definition of the margin and contribute to the classification process.

3. When using SVMs, why is it necessary to scale the inputs?
Answer:
Scaling inputs is necessary in SVMs to ensure that all features have similar scales. SVMs are sensitive to the scale of features, and uneven scales can lead to improper behavior of the model, causing some features to dominate others. Scaling helps achieve better convergence and accurate classification.

4. When an SVM classifier classifies a case, can it output a confidence score? What about a percentage chance?
Answer:
Yes, an SVM classifier can output a confidence score for its classification decisions. However, SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates like some other models. These confidence scores can be used to rank classes or assess the model's confidence in its predictions, but they need to be calibrated to resemble probability estimates.

5. Should you train a model on a training set with millions of instances and hundreds of features using the primal or dual form of the SVM problem?
Answer:
For large datasets with millions of instances and hundreds of features, it's often preferable to use the dual form of the SVM problem. The dual form is more computationally efficient in such cases, as it involves dot products between instances rather than working with the feature space directly.

6. Let's say you've used an RBF kernel to train an SVM classifier, but it appears to underfit the training collection. Is it better to raise or lower (gamma)? What about the letter C?
Answer:
If the SVM classifier with an RBF kernel underfits the training data, you should consider increasing the value of the hyperparameter gamma. Higher gamma values lead to a narrower, more complex decision boundary. As for the parameter C, it controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing the classification error. Increasing C allows the model to classify more training instances correctly even if the margin becomes narrower.

7. To solve the soft margin linear SVM classifier problem with an off-the-shelf QP solver, how should the QP parameters (H, f, A, and b) be set?
Answer:
To set the QP parameters (H, f, A, b) for solving the soft margin linear SVM problem, H is the matrix of dot products of training instances (scaled by labels and kernel function), f is a vector of -1, A is a matrix of training labels transposed, and b is a vector of 0. This formulation aims to minimize 0.5 * w^T * w while satisfying constraints that ensure correct classification.

8. On a linearly separable dataset, train a LinearSVC. Then, using the same dataset, train an SVC and an SGDClassifier. See if you can get them to make a model that is similar to yours.
Answer:
Training LinearSVC, SVC, and SGDClassifier on the same linearly separable dataset should result in similar models that correctly separate the classes. LinearSVC and SVC optimize the same objective function using different solvers, while SGDClassifier uses stochastic gradient descent. Their performance and convergence rate might slightly vary due to optimization techniques.

9. On the MNIST dataset, train an SVM classifier. You'll need to use one-versus-the-rest to assign all 10 digits because SVM classifiers are binary classifiers. To accelerate up the process, you might want to tune the hyperparameters using small validation sets. What level of precision can you achieve?
Answer:
Training an SVM classifier on the MNIST dataset involves using a one-versus-the-rest strategy for multi-class classification. The hyperparameters can be tuned using validation sets to achieve better precision. The achieved precision depends on the chosen kernel, hyperparameters, and the ability of SVM to handle complex relationships in the data.

10. On the California housing dataset, train an SVM regressor.
Answer:
SVM regressor can be trained on the California housing dataset to predict housing prices. The SVM regressor aims to find a hyperplane that best fits the data points, with the goal of minimizing the error between predicted and actual housing prices. The choice of kernel and hyperparameters will influence the performance of the regressor.
