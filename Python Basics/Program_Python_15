Question 1:
Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
100
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,35,70
Answer:
def divisible_by_5_and_7_generator(n):
    for num in range(n + 1):
        if num % 5 == 0 and num % 7 == 0:
            yield num
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = divisible_by_5_and_7_generator(n)
output = ','.join(map(str, result))
print("Output:", output)

Question 2:
Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
10
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,2,4,6,8,10
Answer:
def even_number_generator(n):
    for num in range(0, n + 1, 2):
        yield num
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = even_number_generator(n)
output = ','.join(map(str, result))
print("Output:", output)

Question 3:
The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
Please write a program using list comprehension to print the Fibonacci Sequence in comma separated form with a given n input by console.
Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:
7
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13
Answer:
def fibonacci_sequence(n):
    sequence = [0, 1]
    while len(sequence) < n:
        next_num = sequence[-1] + sequence[-2]
        sequence.append(next_num)
    return sequence
n = int(input("Enter a number: "))
result = fibonacci_sequence(n)
output = ','.join(map(str, result))
print("Output:", output)

Question 4:
Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" format, please write program to print the user name of a given email address. Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.
Example:
If the following email address is given as input to the program:
john@google.com
Then, the output of the program should be:
john
Answer:
email_address = input("Enter an email address: ")
user_name = email_address.split('@')[0]
print("User Name:", user_name)

Question 5:
Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.
Answer:
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        return 0
class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length = length
    def area(self):
        return self.length ** 2
length = float(input("Enter the length of the square: "))
square = Square(length)
print("Area of the square:", square.area())
