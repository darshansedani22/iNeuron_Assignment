1. Set the variable test1 to the string 'This is a test of the emergency text system,' and save test1 to a file named test.txt.
Answer:
test1 = 'This is a test of the emergency text system'
with open('test.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(test1)

2. Read the contents of the file test.txt into the variable test2. Is there a difference between test 1 and test 2?
Answer:
with open('test.txt', 'r') as file:
    test2 = file.read()
difference = test1 == test2

3. Create a CSV file called books.csv by using these lines:
title,author,year
The Weirdstone of Brisingamen,Alan Garner,1960
Perdido Street Station,China Miéville,2000
Thud!,Terry Pratchett,2005
The Spellman Files,Lisa Lutz,2007
Small Gods,Terry Pratchett,1992
Answer:
csv_data = """title,author,year
The Weirdstone of Brisingamen,Alan Garner,1960
Perdido Street Station,China Miéville,2000
Thud!,Terry Pratchett,2005
The Spellman Files,Lisa Lutz,2007
Small Gods,Terry Pratchett,1992
"""
with open('books.csv', 'w') as file:
    file.write(csv_data)

4. Use the sqlite3 module to create a SQLite database called books.db, and a table called books with these fields: title (text), author (text), and year (integer).
Answer:
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('books.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE books
                  (title TEXT, author TEXT, year INTEGER)''')
conn.commit()

5. Read books.csv and insert its data into the book table.
Answer:
import csv
with open('books.csv', 'r') as file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(csv_reader)  # Skip the header row
    for row in csv_reader:
        cursor.execute('INSERT INTO books VALUES (?, ?, ?)', row)
    conn.commit()

6. Select and print the title column from the book table in alphabetical order.
Answer:
cursor.execute('SELECT title FROM books ORDER BY title')
print("Titles in alphabetical order:")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row[0])

7. From the book table, select and print all columns in the order of publication.
Answer:
cursor.execute('SELECT title, author, year FROM books ORDER BY year')
print("\nBooks in the order of publication:")
for row in cursor.fetchall():
    print(row[0], row[1], row[2])

8. Use the sqlalchemy module to connect to the sqlite3 database books.db that you just made in exercise 6.
Answer:
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///books.db')

9. Install the Redis server and the Python redis library (pip install redis) on your computer. Create a Redis hash called test with the fields count (1) and name ('Fester Bestertester'). Print all the fields for test.
Answer:
import redis
redis_conn = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
redis_conn.hset('test', 'count', 1)
redis_conn.hset('test', 'name', 'Fester Bestertester')
test_fields = redis_conn.hgetall('test')
print("\nAll fields for test:")
for field, value in test_fields.items():
    print(f"{field.decode('utf-8')}: {value.decode('utf-8')}")

10. Increment the count field of test and print it.
Answer:
new_count = redis_conn.hincrby('test', 'count', 1)
print("\nIncremented count:", new_count)
