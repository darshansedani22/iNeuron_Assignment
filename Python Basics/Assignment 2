Answer: 

spam = 0 # Block 1
if spam == 10: #Block 2

print('bacon') #Block 3
else: #Block 3
print('ham') #Block 3

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Answer:
All these are used to generate a sequence of numbers to iterate over.
However, all the generate the same sequence of numbers i.e. 0 to 9.

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Answer:

	print(i)
i = 1
while(i<=10):
	print(i)
	i+=1
