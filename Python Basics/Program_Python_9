1.	Write a Python program to check if the given number is a Disarium Number?
Answer:
def is_disarium(number):
    num_str = str(number)
    length = len(num_str)
    total = sum(int(digit) ** (index + 1) for index, digit in enumerate(num_str))
    return total == number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_disarium(num):
    print(f"{num} is a Disarium number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a Disarium number")

2.	Write a Python program to print all disarium numbers between 1 to 100?
Answer:
def is_disarium(number):
    num_str = str(number)
    length = len(num_str)
    total = sum(int(digit) ** (index + 1) for index, digit in enumerate(num_str))
    return total == number
disarium_numbers = [num for num in range(1, 101) if is_disarium(num)]
print("Disarium numbers between 1 and 100:", disarium_numbers)

3.	Write a Python program to check if the given number is Happy Number?
Answer:
def is_happy(number):
    seen_numbers = set()
    while number != 1 and number not in seen_numbers:
        seen_numbers.add(number)
        squared_sum = sum(int(digit) ** 2 for digit in str(number))
        number = squared_sum
    return number == 1
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_happy(num):
    print(f"{num} is a Happy number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a Happy number")

4.	Write a Python program to print all happy numbers between 1 and 100?
Answer:
def is_happy(number):
    seen_numbers = set()
    while number != 1 and number not in seen_numbers:
        seen_numbers.add(number)
        squared_sum = sum(int(digit) ** 2 for digit in str(number))
        number = squared_sum
    return number == 1
happy_numbers = [num for num in range(1, 101) if is_happy(num)]
print("Happy numbers between 1 and 100:", happy_numbers)

5.	Write a Python program to determine whether the given number is a Harshad Number?
Answer:
def is_harshad(number):
    return number % sum(int(digit) for digit in str(number)) == 0
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_harshad(num):
    print(f"{num} is a Harshad number")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a Harshad number")

6.	Write a Python program to print all pronic numbers between 1 and 100?
Answer:
def is_pronic(number):
    for i in range(1, int(number ** 0.5) + 1):
        if i * (i + 1) == number:
            return True
    return False
pronic_numbers = [num for num in range(1, 101) if is_pronic(num)]
print("Pronic numbers between 1 and 100:", pronic_numbers)
