1. Add the current date to the text file today.txt as a string.
Answer:
import datetime
current_date = str(datetime.date.today())
with open('today.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(current_date)

2. Read the text file today.txt into the string today_string
Answer:
with open('today.txt', 'r') as file:
    today_string = file.read()

3. Parse the date from today_string.
Answer:
parsed_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(today_string, '%Y-%m-%d').date()

4. List the files in your current directory
Answer:
current_directory_files = os.listdir('.')
for file_name in current_directory_files:
    print(file_name)

5. Create a list of all of the files in your parent directory (minimum five files should be available).
Answer:
parent_directory_files = os.listdir('..')
for file_name in parent_directory_files:
    print(file_name)

6. Use multiprocessing to create three separate processes. Make each one wait a random number of seconds between one and five, print the current time, and then exit.
Answer:
def print_current_time(process_number):
    wait_time = random.randint(1, 5)
    time.sleep(wait_time)
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    print(f"Process {process_number}: Current time - {current_time}")
processes = []
for i in range(3):
    process = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_current_time, args=(i+1,))
    processes.append(process)
    process.start()
for process in processes:
    process.join()

7. Create a date object of your day of birth.
Answer:
birth_date = datetime.date(year=1990, month=6, day=15)

8. What day of the week was your day of birth?
Answer:
birth_day_of_week = birth_date.strftime('%A')
print(f"\nDay of the week for my day of birth: {birth_day_of_week}")

9. When will you be (or when were you) 10,000 days old?
Answer:
days_to_add = 10000
future_date = birth_date + datetime.timedelta(days=days_to_add)
print(f"\nDate when I'll be 10,000 days old: {future_date}")
